## Install

Copy/paste into your CLI prompt:

```text
Install the i-have-adhd skill/plugin from https://github.com/RyoyaYahagi/i-have-adhd, refer to the repo's AGENTS.md for instructions.
```

Or 🔗 [check the installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

## What it does

A skill for coding assistants that makes answers easier to act on without making the underlying reasoning shallower. It puts the answer or next action first, preserves relevant information through progressive disclosure, and avoids burying useful details in filler.

[Kacper Rutkiewicz | AI Made Simple](https://youtu.be/NEl8kPWZP_Y) has made a good breakdown of an earlier version of the skill.

## What changes

## Before

> Great question! Let me think about this. Your auth flow has a few moving pieces: the middleware, the token verification, and the cookie handling. Looking at `src/auth.ts`, the `verifyToken` function (around lines 42-58) seems to be using an older `jsonwebtoken` API. One approach would be to update the package and rewrite that function. After making the change, you'd want to run the auth tests to confirm nothing breaks. By the way, you might also want to look at your dependency versions overall. Hope this helps! Let me know if you want to dig deeper.

<td width="50%">

## After

> Edit `src/auth.ts:42` to update the token validation.
>
> 1. Open `src/auth.ts`
> 2. Replace `verifyToken` (lines 42–58) with the snippet below
> 3. Run `npm test -- auth.spec.ts`
>
> **Supplemental:** dependency versions may also be stale.
>
> Next: run the test and inspect the first failure, if any.

The skill does not assume every client can render arbitrary collapsible assistant content. If the interface explicitly supports it, supplemental detail can be collapsed. Otherwise it stays visible under a clearly labeled supplemental section instead of being discarded.

## The rules

10 rules. Full text in [SKILL.md](./skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md).

1. Lead with the answer or next action.
2. Number multi-step tasks.
3. End with one concrete next action only when useful.
4. Defer tangents without discarding them.
5. Restate only the state needed to resume.
6. Give time estimates only when grounded.
7. Make completed work visible when useful.
8. Use a matter-of-fact tone for errors.
9. Preserve information; use progressive disclosure.
10. No empty preamble, redundant recap, or closing pleasantries.

The core principle is: **optimize presentation, not reasoning depth**. Shorter visible output must not reduce investigation, verification, candidate generation, analysis, or relevant final information.

## Tune it

Fork, edit `skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md`, then swap your copy in:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall i-have-adhd            # drop the upstream copy first
claude plugin marketplace remove i-have-adhd   # fork and upstream share both names
claude plugin marketplace add <your-username>/i-have-adhd
claude plugin install i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd
```

Restart your coding assistant, then re-invoke `/i-have-adhd`.
